Compute the Black- Scholes call price using R language.
Compute what the price of a call maturing in T = 1 year should be on a stock with current price S0 = 100 and volatility σ = .2, when the riskless rate of interest is r = .05. Write code to do this for every strike K ∈ {75,76,77,...,124,125}, and print the results to the screen. Now suppose that you want to do this for stocks of different maturities also, and that you need to use these prices to conduct some further analysis. For the same S0, r, and σ, populate a matrix with the prices of an option for strikes and maturities (K,T) ∈ {75,76,77,...,124,125} × {1/12,2/12,...23/12,2}. Again compare your results with the results from the built-in R function.
